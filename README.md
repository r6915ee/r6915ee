# rufius (r6915ee)

* I'm an artist, charter (particularly for FNF) and programmer. I mainly only use this account to check repository details and to host private Git repositories, however.
Most of my actual repositories that I may make public will be maintained on my [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/r6915ee-cb), and read-only mirrors may be published here.
* Videogame enthusiast. My notable favorite genres include action, roleplaying, and especially horror. Horror is something that I like very much in general.
* I'm in quite a few fandoms. Notable ones include Sonic the Hedgehog, Friday Night Funkin', and Five Nights at Freddy's.
* I am AroAce.
* I used to be known by several other names, such as petscopf.
