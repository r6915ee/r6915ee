## My main repositories are now on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/r6915ee/), due to GitHub's support for AI extending to replacement and overall lack of humanity. Check [this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159749) for more details.

Any repositories from Codeberg will be mirrored, but no official support will be provided over here.

# rufius (r6915ee)

* I'm an artist, charter (particularly for FNF) and programmer. Some languages
I have programmed in before are **Rust**, **C**, **Haxe**, and **Lua**.
* Videogame enthusiast. My notable favorite genres include action,
roleplaying, and especially horror. Horror is something that I like very much
in general.
* I'm in quite a few fandoms. Notable ones include Sonic the Hedgehog,
Friday Night Funkin', and Five Nights at Freddy's.
* I am AroAce.
* I used to be known by several other names, such as petscopf. However, I do
prefer not to be called by those names.

## Contact

I have a Strawpage linked in my socials. It contains basic information on my
socials and such.
